## Atm, this list is unorganized

- Accept arguments from user in command line
    -Gauge group, coupling, number for experiment (1  = confinement, others...), number for algorithm
    (e.g. Metropolis, Heat Bath)

- Project to unitarity regularly!
- Think about random number generator (how to save seed)
-After each update, manually enforce boundary conditions


Notes for init_array.py
   -Is there a way to automatically account for different dimensions?
   -Add support for other gauge groups
