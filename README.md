# Lattice Gauge Theory

Code base for running Monte Carlo simulations of lattice gauge theories, with certain elementary gauge groups supported. The implementation follows the excellent guide in Chapter 4 of Gattringer--Lang's [lattice QCD book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-01850-3). Our goal is to study confinement in strongly coupled gauge theories, and thus the code is set up to compute expectation values of Wilson loops. 

Also included is a 2018 expository article on lattice gauge theory from a mathematical point of view. We discuss the proofs of various results establishing confinment/deconfinment in the infinite-volume limit of different gauge theories.
